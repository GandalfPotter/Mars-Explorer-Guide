## how to play

### Windows

There is a community-made version of marsxplr, updated to bring back old features that were broken like worlds and multiplayer.
[Download](https://gitea.moe/via256/marsxplr-decomp) it from its gitea releases page.

### MacOS with W.I.N.E. (Before Catalina)

There is a WineBottled version of the windows marsxplr 4.x.x that can run on MacOS.
It only runs on versions before Catalina because it requires you to run 32 bit software.
It can be found labeled __Mars Explorer 4.x.x MacOS (pre-catalina).zip__ in this [Mega Cloud Folder](https://mega.nz/folder/yUVCyBbC#cK5oFDJlWCnpx7TEv-0bUA)

### MacOS with W.I.N.E. (Catalina and Later on Intel CPUs)

Download the WineBottled version that natively executes on Intel X64 from the [Mega Cloud Folder](https://mega.nz/folder/yUVCyBbC#cK5oFDJlWCnpx7TEv-0bUA).
It will be labeled __marsxplr-4.x.x_MacOS_WineBundled__

### MacOS with W.I.N.E (Apple Silicon)

Download the version for __Catalina and Later on Intel CPUs__ entry and run it using [Rosetta](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102527).
If Rosetta does not prompt an install automatically when running the app, try running this command in terminal:
`softwareupdate --install-rosetta` and running the app once it installs.
