# marsxplr guide

a guide to playing this old gem of a game again

## what has changed

Back in the day, you would download the Mars Explorer installer from marsxplr.com.<br>
You also used to be able to play it in browser using unity web player<br>
and it was a widget on mac.<br>
<br>
Now, if you try to download from that site today, the windows version can install and run,<br>
but the mac app and widget do not work unless you are on a somewhat old version of mac os.<br>
<br>
In addition to this, if you run the old windows game, you may notice that none of the worlds work<br>
and multiplayer doesnt work anymore (unless you manually port forward a game).<br>

## solution

The marsxplr community has made it possible to play worlds and use multiplayer again<br>
through the use of a patch to the marsxplr game, as well as community run game servers,<br>

## how to play

### method 1

Download a [patched version of Mars Explorer](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vxM-dJ9OBhHoUq7cJvLBeqhkFTm-g3bc/view?usp=sharing).<br>
Simply download, unzip and run the game from the folder.<br>

### method 2

If you dont feel like downloading a 3rd party version of Mars Explorer from an unverified source,<br>
you can patch the game you already have installed using a [simple python script](https://github.com/VIA256/marsxplr_patch).<br>
Follow the instructions carefully.
